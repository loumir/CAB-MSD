# At a glance

The MANGO model proposes a flexible way to expose data related to astronomical source objects in an interoperable way.
- It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in terms of feature description, format and usage.
- The MANGO model attaches an identifier on an astronomical source and associates to it all data related : observed physical quantities called parameters in this context, and other information like spectra, time series, preview image, for instance,for that source.
- Parameters usually appear in the columns of a source catalogue. Additionnal dataproducts are bound to the source to contribute to the science analysis and enhance data understanding.
- Parameters are modeled by the IVOA MCT DM reusing both native and extended classes. Parameters' roles are given by UCDs and semantic tags.
- Associated data can be simple URLs, VO service endpoints or VO data model instances. Their roles are also qualified by semantic tags.
