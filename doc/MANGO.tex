\begin{abstract}
The MANGO model proposes a flexible way to expose data related to astronomical source objects in an interoperable way.
It takes into account the huge diversity of source data in terms of feature description, format and usage.
The MANGO model attaches an identifier on an astronomical source and associates to it all data related : observed physical quantities called parameters in this context, and other information like spectra, time series, preview image, for instance,for that source.
Parameters usually appear in the columns of a source catalogue. Additionnal dataproducts are bound to the source to contribute to the science analysis and enhance data understanding.
Parameters are modeled by the IVOA MCT DM reusing both native and extended classes. Parameters' roles are given by UCDs and semantic tags.
Associated data can be simple URLs, VO service endpoints or VO data model instances. Their roles are also qualified by semantic tags.

This model was initially named with a very explicit but hard to remember acronym, \texttt{CAB-MSD} standing for Component and Association Based Model for Source Data. We decided later to rename it \texttt{MANGO} with reference to the inside out MANGO picture used to introduce the model in Groningen. As the tradition requires that such unexpected names are acronyms, let's assume that \texttt{MANGO} stands for

\section{Introduction}

Modeling data collected to study astronomical source objects has been a long term concern for the DM working group and more generally for the IVOA.
In the past years, there were some proposals to design a global model for sources \citep{wd:jesusdm} as well as for catalogs \citep{wd:catalog}.
Other proposals, more model-agnostic, were focused on the data annotation in VOTables \citep{note:stcvot} \citep{note:seb}. In this case the goal was no longer to design a source model but to provide a complete description of  individual quantities (positions, velocity, fluxes, magnitudes…).
None of these proposals have come to completion.

The source DM issue resurfaced at the spring 2018 Interop in Victoria during an hands-on session focusing on the tools available to work with VO data models and especially with VO-DML. The goal of this session was to annotate data from different origins in order to make them interoperable with each other.
%mir The main concern expressed during this session was not much related to the tools themselves but indeed to the lack of models for sources.
One of the main concerns outside de tools necessary to workout this notation was the lack of models for source objects.
This is a big paradox in the VO world: source data which represent the basic building blocks of astronomers' work, is not modeled. This paradox can be explained by the fact that the observation of source objects is multi-faceted.
In a general way, the way features for source data are described and organized depends on the targeted science case. Principal investigators and archive designers set up the data profile and structure it according to this goal which varies from one project to another. Therefore this diversity cannot be served by a single static data model describing a source item for all possible cases.
Having a global source model would lead to a very complex solution not usable in practice.

This standard proposes to overcome this paradox and presents a template model gathering independent components from VO existings models together with VO data products and files embedded on demand in a container.
The template supports fine grain association by composing classes as well as coarse grain relations to data products and files distributed within projects archive.

\section{Representing observed astronomical objects : Use Cases and  Requirements}

\subsection{Use Cases}
The following uses-cases have been collected since 2019 from representatives of various astronomical missions, archive designers and tools developers.
\TODO{ may be too early to conclude about this ?? The contribution was totally open. This gave a good picture of the needs but it's safe to say that not everything will supported by this first version.??}

The physical parameters recorded for each source in the various projects are listed below:
\subsubsection{Gaia}
\begin{itemize}
    \item identifier
    \item sky reference position
    \item proper motion
    \item parallax and distance

    \item source extension
    \item radial velocity
    \item redshift
    \item photometry
    \item date of observation ?
    \item correlation ( with other sources ?)
    \item multiple detection
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Euclid}
\begin{itemize}
    \item identifier
    \item sky position
    \item correlation with Gaia counterpart?
    \item photometry (ground + satellite )
    \item morphology class?
    \item redshift
    \item photometric redshift
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Exoplanets missions}
\TODO{mention the involved projects : examples ? GAPS, TESS? }

\begin{itemize}
    \item position
    \item orbit
    \item different source level (source types instead?)(star, planet, moon)
    \item status and classification
    \item orbiting system description
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Morphologically Complex Structures}

\TODO{to be developed ...}
\begin{itemize}
    \item morphology
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Chandra Archive}
This Xray mission has produced a very large catalog of sources. %( ?? TB) \cite{chandra catalog, 2019}.
All quantities are time dependant, depend on calibration methods as well as on appropriate physical
models that selects energy models for the origin of the recorded photons ...
\TODO{to be developed, explained ...}
\begin{itemize}
    \item name
    \item pos
    \item time
    \item extension
    \item PHA ???
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Vizier catalog archive  }
Vizier gathers and delivers a curated version of published catalogs from various missions and experiments.
It also distributes results of scientific papers, based on the computation , comparison and classification of sources extracted from archived data after science analysis.
Vizier handles a very large set of measures in position, photometry, redshift, source type, etc.
% FB : I don't think the end of this sentences was correct : "as authors original data."
It adds value to it by recomputing additional quantities in various reference frames or equivalent spectral bands, units conversions , etc .
It binds the resulting object description to other data sets representing the object, or its conterpart, or neighbourhood (image), its spectral behaviour (spectrum) or evolution through time (light curve, radial velocity curve, timeseries, etc.).
Currently the binding and structure of the quantities is done by column grouping.
\begin{itemize}
    \item pre-existing data
    \item grouping columns
    \item lots of available metadata
    \item column name formatting
    \item one column different frames
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Aladin}

Quantities possibly plotted or matched with some of other datasets
\begin{itemize}
    \item position
    \item time
    \item flux
    \item Field of view (FoV)
    \item column grouping
    \item link to other data products?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{X\-match tool }
The Xmatch operation relies on the comparison of the quantities recorded for each source between several catalogs in order to identify or disentagle counterparts .
%\cite{F-X algo}, 
Chandra X match ??? , others ???
the mandatory quantities to operate such comparison involve:
\begin{itemize}
    \item identifier
    \item position
    \item proper motion
    \item photometry
    \item extension?
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Time Domain }

This Use-case involves measured parameters varying with time
for one or multiple sources

 \begin{itemize}
    \item Identifier: object identifier
    \item Timestamp: Independent axis of the time series
    \item Position: depends on t for a moving object
    \item Photometry: depends on t for light curves
    \item Radial velocity: depends on t for objects submitted to gravitational perturbations
    % I don't think you can see long term variation of radial velocities except in solar system. (FB)
    \item Period
    \item Associated products: time series of e.g. a spectrum or an image

\end{itemize}

There are two categories of information features supported, the measures and the associated data. The measures
 can be numerical values or simple strings. The MANGO datamodel describes measures by relying on the IVOA Meas data model.%\cite{MEAS}.
 Asociated data are related to data with a complex structure or to data just referenced by a URI. Table  \ref{tab:q_breakup} summarizes the features and related quantities exposed in the various use-cases. The two categories clearly show up.

\section{Model Overview}

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{../model/mangoOverview.png}
\caption{MANGO overview}
\label{fig:overview}
\end{figure}


Sky objects are represented by instances of the class \texttt{mangoInstance} which has only one mandatory attribute, the source \texttt{identifier}.
It is recommended the identifiers to be unique within a source collection e.g. a catalog.   

The \texttt{mangoInstance} is a dock for all source parameters and for all data associated to that source.
The pattern of either parameters or associated data attached to a source is not specified by the model. It depends of the datase on which the model is applied.

The \texttt{mangoInstance} has one connector for the paremeters,  the \texttt{parameters} relation, and another for the associatedData, the  \texttt{associatedData}  relations.
Both connectors have an open-ended cardinality.

Each source paremeter is hooked to the \texttt{mangoInstance} by a wrapping class (\texttt{Parameter} ) that contains anything necessary to identify its nature and roler.
Parameters can linked together to represent logical parameter sets. These logical sets have no semantic. Their interpretation is in charge  of the clients.

Each associated data or data pointer is hooked to the \texttt{mangoInstance} by a wrapping class (\texttt{AssociatedData} ) that contains anything necessary to identify its nature and its role.

\subsection{Parameters}

\texttt{Parameter}  connectors are used to bind measures with the source. 
A parameters is composed  by some semantic tags and one measure, instance of \texttt{Measure}. \texttt{Measure} is an abstract class imported from \texttt{meas} model. Concrete classes referended by a parameter are either \texttt{meas}  built-in classes or  \texttt{Measure} sub-classes being part of Mango.

\subsubsection{Parameters Identification}
As the parameter set  attached to a particular instance is not defined by Mango, the model must provide an accurate parameter description to allow the client to figure out what it can do with each of them.
Mango provides 5 description levels for each parameter:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Measure class (vodml type)}: The most current measures are represented by specific  \texttt{Measure} sub-classes. Knowing that class tell the clients  how to interpret the corresponding measure but does help to get its role e.g. a position can be either a source postion or a pointing direction. Furthermore, unusual measures e.g. magnetic field,  are represented by  \texttt{GenericMeasure} . In that case, the vodml type does not help at all.
    \item \textbf{UCD}: A valid UCD must be attached to each parameter. Mango provides a UCD space for each \texttt{Measure} sub-class . UCDs used for specific measures must be compliant with table \ref{tab:ucds}. For generic measures, the UCD choice is in charge of the data provider. In any cases, the consistance between UCDs and measure is the responsability of the data provider.
\TODO{TBC phys.luminosity  vs phot.flux}
    \item \textbf{Reduction status (model enumeration)}: A reduction level of the parameter (e.g. a parameter can be calibrated or not or it can be a computed qualifier) may be attached to the parameter. 
    \item \textbf{Semantic}: A reference to  a valid vocabulary word may be attached to each parameter. The choice of that vocabulary is totally free as long as it is published.    
    \item \textbf{Description}: A free text description may be attached to each parameter.
 \end{itemize}
 
\begin{table}[ht!]
     \begin{tabular}{|p{4cm}|p{3cm}|p{3.5cm}|}
       \hline Parameter &  Original model & UCDs 1+ first word  \\

     \end{tabular}
     \caption{ UCDs to be set for the supported parameters}
     \label{tab:ucds}
 \end{table}



\subsubsection{Measure Extension}

All \texttt{Measure} classes are built upon the same pattern (see Fig \ref{fig:stcpattern}). The value(s) \texttt{Measure} object is carried by a \texttt{Coordinate} object. The coordinate is attached to a system  (\texttt{CoordSys} class). The system has two components : 1) the space  ( \texttt{CoordSpace} class) that describes the axis and 2) the frame ()\texttt{CoordFrame} class).  Parameters in MANGO data model are based on this pattern. Native  \texttt{Measure} classes are used whenever possible. Others Parameters are built by extending this class as shown in figure \ref{fig:stcpattern}). These extended classes are part of MANGO.

\subsection{Associated Data}
\texttt{AssociatedData} connectors are used to bind any sort of complex data with the source. 
One connector can only refer to one dataset. 
Associated data can be either URIs (VO services or not), other mango instances or reference to instances of other VO models (e.g. Obscore, Provenance…).

\subsubsection{AssociatedData Identification}
As the associated data set  attached to a particular instance is not defined by Mango, the model must provide an accurate parameter description to allow the client to figure out what it can do with each of them.
Mango provides 3 description levels for each category of associated data:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data class (vodml type)}: Knowing the class representing associated data tells the clients  how to interpret it but does help to get its role.
    \item \textbf{Semantic}: A reference to  a valid vocabulary word may be attached to each associated data set. The choice of that vocabulary is totally free as long as it is published.    
    \item \textbf{Description}: A free text description may be attached to each associated data .
 \end{itemize}
 
\subsubsection{Associated Model Instances}
The way to attach VO model instances to MANGO sources is very specific in a sense of that Mango gives the model reference by tells nothing about the way import  the instance.  
The model of associated instances must be available as a vodml file.
The \texttt{ModelInstance} is an empty class without sub classes. 
We assumes  that the serialization mechanism is enable to replace the \texttt{ModelInstance} instance with an actual instance of the model. An example in given in appendix xx.

\section{TAP and MANGO}
This not normative section gives possible tips to save and discover MANGO instances in TAP services.
We suppose that the TAP service hosts catalogs which sources are MANGO instances. These catalogs are named \emph{MANGO Catalogs}.

\subsection{Storing MANGO Catalogs in TAP}
For now this section only concerns the parameter. The associated data will be taken into account later.

\begin{itemize}
  \item One master table for the catalogs with various meta-data out of the MANGO scope plus a unique identifier (primary key)
  \item One master sources table for the source instances with the catalog identifier and a primary key safer than the MANGO identifier.
  \item One table for each supported parameter with a foreign key for the join with the master source table
\end{itemize}

Although the model of the measures is hierarchical, it should be possible to flatten them in one single table considering that the model structure can be retrieved with the TAP\_SCHEMA annotations (TBC)

This schema requires the server to explore all the parameter tables to retrieve  whole MANGO instances. This process can be speed up by using the \emph{MANGOCore} table.

\subsection{ \emph{MANGOCore} Table}

The discovery of \emph{MANGO Catalogs} can be helped by a  \emph{MANGOCore} table located in the  \emph{schema} schema. As MANGO is not dedicated to any specific domain, we cannot define a set of core parameters, but parameters can be flagged as \emph{Core Parameter}. This selection is left at the discretion of the curator.
The \emph{MANGOCore} table has set of columns per parameter class plus one for the catalog ID. It has one row per stored catalog. Each parameter has at least 2 columns: one with the UCD an one with the \emph{Core} flag. TBC
